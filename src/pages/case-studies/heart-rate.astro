            <h2>1. The Setup: A Leaky Funnel & a Crisis of Trust</h2>
            <p>
                In late 2022, the Heart Rate Monitor (BPM) was a strategic bet
                on organic growth and user engagement. The business objective
                was two-fold: create a "wow" moment for <strong
                    >first-time users</strong
                > to drive acquisition, and build a valuable tool that <strong
                    >repeat users</strong
                > would integrate into their health routines.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, analytics painted a grim picture. The feature was
                underperforming dramatically. Our primary business metrics were
                failing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>First-Time User Conversion:</strong> A catastrophic ~38%
                    of users were dropping off before successfully completing their
                    first measurement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Long-Term Retention:</strong> Churn analysis showed that
                    even users who were successful once rarely came back. The feature
                    wasn't "sticking."

            <h3>Positioning Eka as a Trustworthy Health Partner</h3>
            <p>
                This initiative was more than a redesign; it was a strategic
                turnaround. By grounding our decisions in deep user research and
                data, we transformed a failing feature into a core pillar of the
                Eka.Care experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Detailed Conversion Funnel Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The redesign delivered remarkable improvements across the entire
                user journey, with the most significant impact coming from
                addressing the critical 38% drop-off point.

                            Our biggest breakthrough came from shifting from
                            reactive to proactive design. Instead of handling
                            errors after they occurred, we built systems that
                            prevented failure before it happened. This approach
                            reduced measurement failures by 78% and user
                            frustration by 65%.
