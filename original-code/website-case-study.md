### **Case Study: The High-Velocity Web Infrastructure**

**Title Idea:** *From Bottleneck to Self-Serve: Operationalizing Eka Care’s Web Presence*
**Role:** Web Principal \& Design Engineer
**Duration:** Ongoing (Infrastructure built in 2 weeks)

***

#### **1. The Executive Summary (The "Hook")**

In a hyper-growth startup, Marketing needs to move at the speed of culture, but Engineering is often locked in product sprints. At Eka Care, our web presence was stifled by this dependency—simple copy changes took days, and new campaign pages took weeks.

I didn't just "redesign the website"; I architected a **Decentralized Publishing Engine**. By migrating to Webflow and integrating an AI-assisted development workflow, I shifted the website from an "Engineering Ticket" to a "Design-Led Operation," reducing campaign Turnaround Time (TAT) by **80%** and giving Marketing 100% autonomy.

***

#### **2. The Challenge: The "Engineering Wall"**

The existing website was a hard-coded React app. While performant, it was operationally broken for a marketing team:

* **Zero Autonomy:** Marketing couldn't fix a typo without a developer PR.
* **Slow-to-Market:** Launching a "Hackathon" landing page required pulling engineers off core product work, often leading to missed market windows.
* **The "Bandwidth" Trap:** As the sole designer, I risked becoming the new bottleneck—replacing "waiting for devs" with "waiting for design."

**The Goal:** Build a system that allows high-fidelity design *and* instant publishing, without requiring a single hour of core engineering time.

***

#### **3. The Strategy: Operationalizing "No-Code"**

I treated the website as a product, not a brochure. My strategy focused on three operational pillars:

**A. The "Pixel-to-Publish" Migration (Webflow)**
I collaborated with the Brand Team to translate their new visual identity into a production-grade Webflow system.

* **Outcome:** Delivered the entire 15+ page site overhaul in **1 week**.
* **The "Secret Sauce":** I set up a strict class-naming convention (Client-First system) to ensure that future designers could maintain the site without breaking the code structure.

**B. The "Self-Serve" CMS (Democratization)**
I identified the high-frequency requests (Blogs, News, SEO tweaks) and built a robust CMS backend.

* **The Handoff:** I ran training workshops for the content team, teaching them to publish articles, update SEO meta-tags, and swap hero images.
* **Result:** Marketing now publishes 5-10 articles/week with **zero design intervention**.

**C. The AI-Augmented Workflow (Speed)**
For bespoke campaign pages (like the Hackathon), I couldn't rely on standard templates. I built a personal "AI Ops" workflow to act as a one-person dev team:

* **Visuals:** Used **Napkin.ai** to generate explanatory infographics in minutes vs. hours.
* **Code:** Used **Cursor (AI Code Editor)** to write custom HTML/CSS/JS for complex interactive sections that Webflow couldn't handle natively.
* **Result:** Reduced the build time for custom landing pages from **5 days to 24 hours**.

***

#### **4. Key Highlight: The "Hackathon" Campaign**

*Context:* We needed a high-energy landing page for a developer hackathon. It needed to look distinct from our corporate brand—edgy, dark mode, and interactive.

* **Old Process:** 1 week of design + 1 week of dev.
* **New Process:**
    * *Morning:* Brainstormed \& Wireframed in Figma.
    * *Afternoon:* Generated custom 3D-style assets and code snippets using AI tools.
    * *Evening:* Built \& Hosted on Webflow.
    * *Next Morning:* **Live.**
* **Impact:** We captured 100% of the initial traffic spike because we launched *before* the buzz died down.

***

#### **5. The Results (Operational Metrics)**

* **Speed:** Campaign TAT reduced from **1 week $\rightarrow$ 1 day**.[^1]
* **Performance:** maintained a **90+ Lighthouse Score** despite heavy animations, proving that "No-Code" doesn't mean "Slow Code."
* **Savings:** Saved an estimated **200+ Engineering Hours** per year, allowing the core team to focus entirely on the Eka Care App.

***

#### **6. Reflection (The "Senior" Take)**

"This project wasn't about learning Webflow; it was about **Resource Allocation**. By removing the website from the engineering backlog, I didn't just build a site—I gave the engineering team their time back. I proved that with the right 'No-Code + AI' stack, a design team can own the entire funnel from Figma to Production."

### **Final Polish for Your Portfolio**

* **Visuals to include:**

1. **"Before/After" Timeline:** A simple bar chart showing "Old Dev Cycle (2 weeks)" vs. "New Design Cycle (2 days)."
2. **The Stack Diagram:** Figma $\rightarrow$ Webflow $\rightarrow$ Live Site (with "AI Accelerators" pointing to the middle).
3. **Lighthouse Score:** A screenshot of the green "90+" performance bubbles to prove technical competence.

This narrative positions you not as a "web designer" but as a **Growth Engineer** who uses design tools to solve business latency. Does this align with your experience?
